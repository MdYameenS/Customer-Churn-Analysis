📉 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard
🎯 Purpose: A Power BI dashboard to predict and mitigate customer churn by analyzing behavioral patterns, demographics, and service usage [Practice Project].
✨ Key Features:

👥 Demographic Insights: Analyzed 7K+ customers with near-equal gender distribution (Male: 50.4%, Female: 49.6%).

💳 Payment Trends: Identified 64.4% of customers prefer Electronic checks over credit cards (21.7%) or bank transfers.

📅 Tenure Analysis: Segmented customers by loyalty (0–80 months) to pinpoint at-risk cohorts.

🔒 Service Impact: Linked churn to low adoption of Online Security (1.2K without) and Online Backup (0.5K without).

🎯 Goal Tracking: Monitored retention targets (e.g., +6,332.75% progress toward 3,555 customers).
🛠️ Technologies: Power BI (DAX, Drill-throughs, Custom Visuals), Excel (Data Cleaning).
🌟 My Role: Solo developer – Built data models, wrote DAX formulas, and designed interactive reports.
🔥 Challenges & Wins:

Automated cohort analysis using DAX time-intelligence functions (DATEDIFF, CALCULATE).

Created dynamic risk scores for churn prediction by combining payment method and tenure data.

Resolved data skews with DAX IFERROR and DIVIDE functions for accurate gender/payment splits.
📈 Outcome: Uncovered that customers without Online Security are 3x more likely to churn, enabling targeted retention campaigns.
